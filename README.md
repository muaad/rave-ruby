# RaveRuby

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/MaestroJolly/rave-ruby.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/MaestroJolly/rave-ruby) [![Gem Version](https://badge.fury.io/rb/rave_ruby.svg)](https://badge.fury.io/rb/rave_ruby)

This is a Ruby gem for easy integration of Rave API for various applications written in Ruby language from [Rave](https://rave.flutterwave.com) by [Flutterwave.](https://developer.flutterwave.com/reference)

## Documentation

See [Here](https://developer.flutterwave.com/reference) for Rave API Docs.

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'rave_ruby'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install rave_ruby

## Usage

### Initialization

#### Instantiate rave object in sandbox with environment variable:

To use [Rave](https://ravesandbox.flutterwave.com), you need to instantiate the `RaveRuby` class with your [API](https://ravesandbox.flutterwave.com/dashboard/settings/apis) keys which are your public and secret keys. We recommend that you store your API keys in your environment variable named `RAVE_PUBLIC_KEY` and `RAVE_SECRET_KEY`. Instantiating your rave object after adding your API keys in your environment is as illustrated below:

```ruby
rave = RaveRuby.new
```
This throws a `RaveBadKeyError` if no key is found in the environment variable or invalid public or secret key is found.

#### Instantiate rave object in sandbox without environment variable:

You can instantiate your rave object by setting your public and secret keys by passing them as an argument of the `RaveRuby` class just as displayed below: 

```ruby
rave = RaveRuby.new("YOUR_RAVE_SANDBOX_PUBLIC_KEY", "YOUR_RAVE_SANDBOX_SECRET_KEY")
```

#### NOTE: It is best practice to always set your API keys to your environment variable for security purpose. Please be warned not use this package without setting your API keys in your environment variables in production.

#### To instantiate rave object in production with environment variable:

Simply use it as displayed below:

```ruby
rave = RaveRuby.new("YOUR_RAVE_LIVE_PUBLIC_KEY", "YOUR_RAVE_LIVE_SECRET_KEY", true)
```

## `RaveAccount.new(rave)`

To perform account transactions, instantiate the account object and pass rave object as its argument.

Its functions includes:

- `.initiate_charge`
- `.validate_charge`
- `.verify_charge`

### `.initiate_charge(payload)`

This function is called to initiate account transaction. The payload should be a Ruby hash with account details. Its parameters should include the following:

- `accountbank`,

- `accountnumber`,

- `amount`,

- `email`,

- `phonenumber`,

- `IP`

You can also add your custom transaction reference `(txRef)`, if not, one would be automatically generated for you in which we used the ruby `securerandom` module for generating this in the `Util` module.

#### Sample `account charge` call:

```ruby
response = charge_account.initiate_charge(payload)
```

#### which returns:

It returns this response in Ruby hash. A sample response:

```ruby
{
    "error"=>false, "status"=>"success", "validation_required"=>true, "message"=>"V-COMP", "suggested_auth"=>nil, "txRef"=>"MC-2232eed54ca72f8ae2125f49020fb592", "flwRef"=>"ACHG-1544908923260", "chargeResponseCode"=>"02", "chargeResponseMessage"=>"Pending OTP validation", "amount"=>100, "currency"=>"NGN", "validateInstruction"=>"Please dial *901*4*1# to get your OTP. Enter the OTP gotten in the field below", "paymentType"=>"account", "authModelUsed"=>"AUTH", "authurl"=>"NO-URL"
}
```

A `RaveServerError` is raised if there's an error with the charge.

#### Sample error response if an exception is raised:

```ruby
{
    "status":"error","message":"Sorry that account number is invalid. Please check and try again","data":{"code":"FLW_ERR","message":"Sorry that account number is invalid. Please check and try again","err_tx":{"id":360210,"flwRef":"ACHG-1544910130710","chargeResponseCode":"RR","chargeResponseMessage":"Sorry that account number is invalid. Please check and try again","status":"failed","merchantbearsfee":1,"appfee":"1.4","merchantfee":"0","charged_amount":"100.00"
}}}
```

### `.validate_charge(flwRef, "OTP")`

After a successful charge, most times you will be asked to verify with OTP. To check if this is required, check the validation_required key in the response of the charge call i.e `response["validation_required"]` is equal to `true`.

In the case that an `authUrl` is returned from your charge call, you may skip the validation step and simply pass your authurl to the end-user as displayed below:

```ruby
authurl = response['authurl']
```

If validation is required by OTP, you need to pass the `flwRef` from the response of the charge call as well as the OTP.

#### Sample `validate_charge` call:

```ruby
response = charge_account.validate_charge(response["flwRef"], "12345")
```

#### which returns:

It returns this response in Ruby hash with the `txRef` and `flwRef` amongst its successful response:

```ruby
{
    "error"=>false, "status"=>"success", "message"=>"Charge Complete", "txRef"=>"MC-c0c707a798de82f34b937e6126844d6c", "flwRef"=>"ACHG-1544963949493", "amount"=>100, "currency"=>"NGN", "chargeResponseCode"=>"00", "chargeResponseMessage"=>"Pending OTP validation"
}
```

If an error occurs during OTP validation, you will receive a response similar to this:

```ruby
{
    "error"=>true, "status"=>"success", "message"=>"Charge Complete", "txRef"=>"MC-4cd9b2e4a9a104f92273ce194993ab50", "flwRef"=>"ACHG-1544969082006", "amount"=>100, "currency"=>"NGN", "chargeResponseCode"=>"02", "chargeResponseMessage"=>"Pending OTP validation"
}
```

With `chargeResponseCode` still equals to `02` which means it didn't validate successfully and is till pending validation.

Otherwise if validation is successful using OTP, you will receive a response similar to this:

```ruby
{
    "error"=>false, "status"=>"success", "message"=>"Charge Complete", "txRef"=>"MC-c0c707a798de82f34b937e6126844d6c", "flwRef"=>"ACHG-1544963949493", "amount"=>100, "currency"=>"NGN", "chargeResponseCode"=>"00", "chargeResponseMessage"=>"Pending OTP validation"
}
```

With `chargeResponseCode` equals to `00` which means it validated successfully.

### `.verify_charge(txRef)`

You can call the `verify_charge` function to check if your transaction was completed successfully. To do this, you have to pass the transaction reference generated at the point of making your charge call. This is the txRef in the response parameter returned in any of the `initiate_charge` or `validate_charge` call.

#### Sample `verify_charge` call:

```ruby
response = charge_account.verify_charge(response["txRef"])
```

#### which returns:

It returns this response in Ruby hash with the `txRef`, `flwRef` and `transaction_complete` which indicates the transaction is successfully completed.

Full sample response returned if a transaction is successfully verified:

```ruby
{
    "error"=>false, "transaction_complete"=>true, "data"=>{"txid"=>360744, "txref"=>"MC-c0c707a798de82f34b937e6126844d6c", "flwref"=>"ACHG-1544963949493", "devicefingerprint"=>"69e6b7f0b72037aa8428b70fbe03986c", "cycle"=>"one-time", "amount"=>100, "currency"=>"NGN", "chargedamount"=>100, "appfee"=>1.4, "merchantfee"=>0, "merchantbearsfee"=>1, "chargecode"=>"00", "chargemessage"=>"Pending OTP validation", "authmodel"=>"AUTH", "ip"=>"::ffff:10.11.193.41", "narration"=>"Simply Recharge", "status"=>"successful",
    "vbvcode"=>"N/A", "vbvmessage"=>"N/A", "authurl"=>"NO-URL", "acctcode"=>"00", "acctmessage"=>"Approved Or Completed Successfully", "paymenttype"=>"account", "paymentid"=>"90", "fraudstatus"=>"ok", "chargetype"=>"normal", "createdday"=>0, "createddayname"=>"SUNDAY", "createdweek"=>50, "createdmonth"=>11, "createdmonthname"=>"DECEMBER", "createdquarter"=>4, "createdyear"=>2018, "createdyearisleap"=>false, "createddayispublicholiday"=>0, "createdhour"=>12, "createdminute"=>39, "createdpmam"=>"pm", "created"=>"2018-12-16T12:39:08.000Z", "customerid"=>64794, "custphone"=>"08134836828", "custnetworkprovider"=>"MTN", "custname"=>"ifunanya Ikemma", "custemail"=>"mijux@xcodes.net", "custemailprovider"=>"COMPANY EMAIL", "custcreated"=>"2018-11-26T11:35:24.000Z", "accountid"=>6076, "acctbusinessname"=>"Simply Recharge", "acctcontactperson"=>"Jolaoso Yusuf", "acctcountry"=>"NG", "acctbearsfeeattransactiontime"=>1, "acctparent"=>1, "acctvpcmerchant"=>"N/A", "acctalias"=>nil, "acctisliveapproved"=>0, "orderref"=>"URF_1544963948269_113435", "paymentplan"=>nil, "paymentpage"=>nil, "raveref"=>"RV31544963947776E1DB61E313", "amountsettledforthistransaction"=>98.6, "account"=>{"id"=>90, "account_number"=>"0690000033", "account_bank"=>"044", "first_name"=>"NO-NAME", "last_name"=>"NO-LNAME", "account_is_blacklisted"=>0, "createdAt"=>"2017-04-26T12:54:22.000Z", "updatedAt"=>"2018-12-16T12:39:23.000Z", "deletedAt"=>nil, "account_token"=>{"token"=>"flw-t03a483b4eecf61cda-k3n-mock"}}, "meta"=>[]}
}

```

If a transaction couldn't be verified successfully, `error` and `transaction_complete` would both come as `false`.

#### Full RaveAccount Transaction Flow:

```ruby
require 'rave_ruby'

# This is a rave object which is expecting public and secret keys
rave = RaveRuby.new("FLWPUBK-xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx-X", "FLWSECK-xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx-X")

# This is used to perform card charge
payload = {
    "accountbank" => "044",
    "accountnumber" => "0690000033",
    "currency" => "NGN",
    "payment_type" =>  "account",
    "country" => "NG",
    "amount" => "100", 
    "email" => "mijux@xcodes.net",
    "phonenumber" => "08134836828",

}

charge_account = RaveAccount.new(rave)

response = charge_account.initiate_charge(payload)
print response

# Perform validation if it is required
if response["validation_required"]
    response = charge_account.validate_charge(response["flwRef"], "12345")
    print response
end

# Verify charge
response = charge_account.verify_charge(response["txRef"])
print response
```

## `Card.new(rave)`

To perform card transactions, instantiate the card object and pass rave object as its argument.

Its functions includes:

- `.initiate_charge`
- `.get_auth_type`
- `.update_payload`
- `.tokenized_charge`
- `.validate_charge`
- `.verify_charge`

### `.initiate_charge(payload)`

This function is called to initiate card transaction. The payload should be a Ruby hash with card details. Its parameters should include the following:

- `cardno`,

- `cvv`,

- `expirymonth`,

- `expiryyear`,

- `amount`,

- `email`,

- `phonenumber`,

- `firstname`,

- `lastname`,

- `IP`

You can also add your custom transaction reference `(txRef)`, if not, one would be automatically generated for you in which we used the ruby `securerandom` module for generating this in the `Util` module.

#### Sample `card charge` call:

```ruby
response = charge_card.initiate_charge(payload)
```

You need to make this initial charge call to get the suggested_auth for the transaction.

#### which returns:

It returns this response in Ruby hash. A sample response:

```ruby
{
    "error"=>false, "status"=>"success", "validation_required"=>true, "message"=>"AUTH_SUGGESTION", "suggested_auth"=>"PIN", "txRef"=>nil, "flwRef"=>nil, "chargeResponseCode"=>nil, "chargeResponseMessage"=>nil, "amount"=>nil, "currency"=>nil, "validateInstruction"=>nil, "paymentType"=>nil, "authModelUsed"=>nil, "authurl"=>nil
}
```

A `RaveServerError` is raised if there's an error with the card charge.

#### Sample error response if an exception is raised:

```ruby
{
    "status":"error","message":"Card number is invalid","data":{"code":"ERR","message":"Card number is invalid"
    }
}
```

### `.update_payload(suggested_auth, payload, pin or address)`

You need to update the payload with `pin` or `address` parameters depending on the `suggested_auth` returned from the initial charge call i.e `suggested_auth = response["suggested_auth"]` and passing it as a parameter of the `.get_auth_type(suggested_auth)` method.

If the `suggested_auth` returned is `pin`, update the payload with this method `charge_card.update_payload(suggested_auth, payload, pin: "CUSTOMER CARD PIN")`. 

If the `suggested_auth` returned is `address`, update the payload with this method `charge_card.update_payload(suggested_auth, payload, address:{"A Ruby hash OF CUSTOMER'S BILLING ADDRESS"})`. 

This is what the Ruby hash billing address consists:

- `billingzip`,

- `billingcity`,

- `billingaddress`,

- `billingstate`,

- `billingcountry`

After updating the payload, you will need to make the `.initiate_charge` call again with the updated payload, as displayed below:

```ruby
response = charge_card.initiate_charge(updated_payload)
```

This is a sample response returned after updating payload with suggested_auth `pin`:

```ruby
{
    "error"=>false, "status"=>"success", "validation_required"=>true, "message"=>"V-COMP", "suggested_auth"=>nil, "txRef"=>"MC-d8c02b9bdf21d02aa7ab276cda3177ae", "flwRef"=>"FLW-MOCK-68d8095eab1abdb69805be0a55d84630", "chargeResponseCode"=>"02", "chargeResponseMessage"=>"Please enter the OTP sent to your mobile number 080****** and email te**@rave**.com", "amount"=>10, "currency"=>"NGN", "validateInstruction"=>nil, "paymentType"=>"card", "authModelUsed"=>"PIN", "authurl"=>"N/A"
}
```

### `.validate_charge(flwRef, "OTP")`

After a successful charge, most times you will be asked to verify with OTP. To check if this is required, check the validation_required key in the response of the charge call i.e `response["validation_required"]` is equal to `true`.

In the case that an `authUrl` is returned from your charge call, you may skip the validation step and simply pass your authurl to the end-user as displayed below:

```ruby
authurl = response['authurl']
```

If validation is required by OTP, you need to pass the `flwRef` from the response of the charge call as well as the OTP.

A sample `validate_charge` call:

```ruby
response = charge_card.validate_charge(response["flwRef"], "12345")
```

#### which returns:

It returns this response in Ruby hash with the `txRef` and `flwRef` amongst its successful response:

```ruby
{
    "error"=>false, "status"=>"success", "message"=>"Charge Complete", "txRef"=>"MC-d8c02b9bdf21d02aa7ab276cda3177ae", "flwRef"=>"FLW-MOCK-68d8095eab1abdb69805be0a55d84630", "amount"=>10, "currency"=>"NGN", "chargeResponseCode"=>"00", "chargeResponseMessage"=>"Please enter the OTP sent to your mobile number 080****** and email te**@rave**.com"
}
```

If an error occurs during OTP validation, you will receive a response similiar to this:

```ruby
{
    "error"=>true, "status"=>"success", "message"=>"Charge Complete", "txRef"=>"MC-155418209b1cf2812da3ceb57e541ef0", "flwRef"=>"FLW-MOCK-35167122c73ccdd8ee796b71042af101", "amount"=>100, "currency"=>"NGN", "chargeResponseCode"=>"02", "chargeResponseMessage"=>"Pending OTP validation"
}
```

With `chargeResponseCode` still equals to `02` which means it didn't validate successfully and is till pending validation.

Otherwise if validation is successful using OTP, you will receive a response similar to this:

```ruby
{
    "error"=>false, "status"=>"success", "message"=>"Charge Complete", "txRef"=>"MC-eac8888322fa44343d1a3ed7c8025fde", "flwRef"=>"FLW-MOCK-01cb1be7b183cfdec0d5225316647378", "amount"=>10, "currency"=>"NGN", "chargeResponseCode"=>"00", "chargeResponseMessage"=>"Please enter the OTP sent to your mobile number 080****** and email te**@rave**.com"
}
```

With `chargeResponseCode` equals to `00` which means it validated successfully.

### `.verify_charge(txRef)`

You can call the `verify_charge` function to check if your transaction was completed successfully. To do this, you have to pass the transaction reference generated at the point of making your charge call. This is the txRef in the response parameter returned in any of the `initiate_charge` or `validate_charge` call.

#### Sample `verify_charge` call:

```ruby
response = charge_card.verify_charge(response["txRef"])
```

#### which returns:

It returns this response in Ruby hash with the `txRef`, `flwRef` and `transaction_complete` which indicates the transaction is successfully completed.

Full sample response returned if a transaction is successfully verified:

```ruby
{
    "error"=>false, "transaction_complete"=>true, "data"=>{"txid"=>362093, "txref"=>"MC-eac8888322fa44343d1a3ed7c8025fde", "flwref"=>"FLW-MOCK-01cb1be7b183cfdec0d5225316647378", "devicefingerprint"=>"69e6b7f0b72037aa8428b70fbe03986c", "cycle"=>"one-time", "amount"=>10, "currency"=>"NGN", "chargedamount"=>10, "appfee"=>0.14, "merchantfee"=>0, "merchantbearsfee"=>1, "chargecode"=>"00", "chargemessage"=>"Please enter the OTP sent to your mobile number 080****** and email te**@rave**.com", "authmodel"=>"PIN", "ip"=>"::ffff:10.69.80.227", "narration"=>"CARD Transaction ", "status"=>"successful", "vbvcode"=>"00", "vbvmessage"=>"successful", "authurl"=>"N/A", "acctcode"=>nil, "acctmessage"=>nil, "paymenttype"=>"card", "paymentid"=>"861", "fraudstatus"=>"ok", "chargetype"=>"normal", "createdday"=>1, "createddayname"=>"MONDAY", "createdweek"=>51, "createdmonth"=>11, "createdmonthname"=>"DECEMBER", "createdquarter"=>4, "createdyear"=>2018, "createdyearisleap"=>false, "createddayispublicholiday"=>0, "createdhour"=>17, "createdminute"=>4, "createdpmam"=>"pm", "created"=>"2018-12-17T17:04:45.000Z", "customerid"=>51655, "custphone"=>"0902620185", "custnetworkprovider"=>"AIRTEL", "custname"=>"temi desola", "custemail"=>"user@gmail.com", "custemailprovider"=>"GMAIL", "custcreated"=>"2018-09-24T07:59:14.000Z", "accountid"=>6076, "acctbusinessname"=>"Simply Recharge", "acctcontactperson"=>"Jolaoso Yusuf", "acctcountry"=>"NG", "acctbearsfeeattransactiontime"=>1, "acctparent"=>1, "acctvpcmerchant"=>"N/A", "acctalias"=>nil, "acctisliveapproved"=>0, "orderref"=>"URF_1545066285779_8747935", "paymentplan"=>nil, "paymentpage"=>nil, "raveref"=>"RV3154506628468675C4CD519A", "amountsettledforthistransaction"=>9.86, "card"=>{"expirymonth"=>"09", "expiryyear"=>"19", "cardBIN"=>"543889", "last4digits"=>"0229", "brand"=>"MASHREQ BANK CREDITSTANDARD", "card_tokens"=>[{"embedtoken"=>"flw-t1nf-75aa4a20695a54c1846e0e8bcae754ee-m03k", "shortcode"=>"671c0", "expiry"=>"9999999999999"}], "type"=>"MASTERCARD", "life_time_token"=>"flw-t1nf-75aa4a20695a54c1846e0e8bcae754ee-m03k"}, "meta"=>[{"id"=>1257583, "metaname"=>"flightID", "metavalue"=>"123949494DC", "createdAt"=>"2018-12-17T17:04:46.000Z", "updatedAt"=>"2018-12-17T17:04:46.000Z", "deletedAt"=>nil, "getpaidTransactionId"=>362093}]}
}
```

NOTE: You can tokenize a card after charging the card for the first time for subsequent transactions done with the card without having to send the card details everytime a transaction is done. The card token can be gotten from the `.verify_charge` response, here's how to get the card token from our sample verify response:

`response['card']['card_tokens']['embed_tokens']` which is similar to this: `flw-t1nf-75aa4a20695a54c1846e0e8bcae754ee-m03k`

### `.tokenized_charge(payload)`

This function is called to perform a charge a tokenized card. Its payload includes;

- `token`,

- `country`,

- `amount`,

- `email`,

- `firstname`,

- `lastname`,

- `txRef`,

- `currency`

#### Sample `tokenized charge` call:

```ruby
response = charge_card.tokenized_charge(payload)
```

#### which returns:

It returns this response in Ruby hash. A sample response:

```ruby
{
    "error"=>false, "status"=>"success", "validation_required"=>false, "message"=>"Charge success", "suggested_auth"=>nil, "txRef"=>"MC-f1085c1793bfaf171e667a21be6ec121", "flwRef"=>"FLW-M03K-218f54e6a06dc7da152f115c561f32d2", "chargeResponseCode"=>"00", "chargeResponseMessage"=>"Approved", "amount"=>10, "currency"=>"NGN", "validateInstruction"=>nil, "paymentType"=>"card", "authModelUsed"=>"noauth", "authurl"=>"N/A"
}

```
You can now verify the transaction by calling the `.verify_charge` function to verify the transaction and get the full response of the transaction.

#### Sample `verify_charge` call:

```ruby
response = charge_card.verify_charge(response["txRef"])
```

#### which returns:

It returns this response in Ruby hash with the `txRef`, `flwRef` and `transaction_complete` which indicates the transaction is successfully completed.

Full sample response returned if a transaction is successfully verified:

```ruby
{
    "error"=>false, "transaction_complete"=>true, "data"=>{"txid"=>390050, "txref"=>"MC-f1085c1793bfaf171e667a21be6ec121", "flwref"=>"FLW-M03K-218f54e6a06dc7da152f115c561f32d2", "devicefingerprint"=>"N/A", "cycle"=>"one-time", "amount"=>10, "currency"=>"NGN", "chargedamount"=>10, "appfee"=>0.14, "merchantfee"=>0, "merchantbearsfee"=>1, "chargecode"=>"00", "chargemessage"=>"Approved", "authmodel"=>"noauth", "ip"=>"355426087298442", "narration"=>"Simply Recharge", "status"=>"successful", "vbvcode"=>"00", "vbvmessage"=>"Approved", "authurl"=>"N/A", "acctcode"=>nil, "acctmessage"=>nil, "paymenttype"=>"card", "paymentid"=>"861", "fraudstatus"=>"ok", "chargetype"=>"normal", "createdday"=>1, "createddayname"=>"MONDAY", "createdweek"=>3, "createdmonth"=>0, "createdmonthname"=>"JANUARY", "createdquarter"=>1, "createdyear"=>2019, "createdyearisleap"=>false, "createddayispublicholiday"=>0, "createdhour"=>12, "createdminute"=>57, "createdpmam"=>"pm", "created"=>"2019-01-14T12:57:33.000Z", "customerid"=>51655, "custphone"=>"0902620185", "custnetworkprovider"=>"AIRTEL", "custname"=>"temi desola", "custemail"=>"user@gmail.com", "custemailprovider"=>"GMAIL", "custcreated"=>"2018-09-24T07:59:14.000Z", "accountid"=>6076, "acctbusinessname"=>"Simply Recharge", "acctcontactperson"=>"Jolaoso Yusuf", "acctcountry"=>"NG", "acctbearsfeeattransactiontime"=>1, "acctparent"=>1, "acctvpcmerchant"=>"N/A", "acctalias"=>nil, "acctisliveapproved"=>0, "orderref"=>"URF_86BFB6FF6B6BB6CD6C9E", "paymentplan"=>nil, "paymentpage"=>nil, "raveref"=>nil, "amountsettledforthistransaction"=>9.86, "card"=>{"expirymonth"=>"09", "expiryyear"=>"19", "cardBIN"=>"543889", "last4digits"=>"0229", "brand"=>"MASHREQ BANK CREDITSTANDARD", "card_tokens"=>[{"embedtoken"=>"flw-t1nf-75aa4a20695a54c1846e0e8bcae754ee-m03k", "shortcode"=>"671c0", "expiry"=>"9999999999999"}], "type"=>"MASTERCARD", "life_time_token"=>"flw-t1nf-75aa4a20695a54c1846e0e8bcae754ee-m03k"}, "meta"=>[{"id"=>1263976, "metaname"=>"flightID", "metavalue"=>"123949494DC", "createdAt"=>"2019-01-14T12:57:33.000Z", "updatedAt"=>"2019-01-14T12:57:33.000Z", "deletedAt"=>nil, "getpaidTransactionId"=>390050}]}
}
```

If a transaction couldn't be verified successfully, `error` and `transaction_complete` would both come as `false`.

## `Preauth.new(rave)`

This is used to process a preauthorized card transaction.

Its functions includes:

- `.initiate_charge`
- `.capture`
- `.refund`
- `.void`
- `.verify_preauth`

The payload should be a Ruby hash containing card information. It should have the following parameters:

- `token`,

- `country`,

- `amount`,

- `email`,

- `firstname`,

- `lastname`,

- `IP`,

- `txRef`,

- `currency`

NOTE: You need to use the same email used when charging the card for the first time to successfully charge the card.

You can also add your custom transaction reference `(txRef)`, if not, one would be automatically generated for you in which we used the ruby `securerandom` module for generating this in the `Util` module.

#### Sample `initiate_charge` call:

```ruby
response = preauth.initiate_charge(payload)
```

#### which returns:

It returns this response in Ruby hash. A sample response:

```ruby
{
    "error"=>false, "status"=>"pending-capture", "message"=>"Charge success", "validation_required"=>false, "txRef"=>"MC-0df3e7e6cd58b226d4ba2a3d03dd200b", "flwRef"=>"FLW-PREAUTH-M03K-abdc01e69aa424b9e1ac44987ec21ec3", "amount"=>1000, "currency"=>"NGN", "paymentType"=>"card"
}
```

### `.capture(flwRef)`

The capture method is called after the preauth card has been charged. It takes in the `flwRef` from the charge response and call optionally take in amount less than the original amount authorised on the card as displayed below.

#### Sample `capture` call:

```ruby
response = preauth.capture(response["flwRef"], "30")
```

#### which returns:

It returns this response in Ruby hash. A sample response:

```ruby
{
    "error"=>false, "status"=>"successful", "message"=>"Capture complete", "validation_required"=>false, "txRef"=>"MC-0df3e7e6cd58b226d4ba2a3d03dd200b", "flwRef"=>"FLW-PREAUTH-M03K-abdc01e69aa424b9e1ac44987ec21ec3", "amount"=>30, "currency"=>"NGN", "chargeResponseCode"=>"00", "chargeResponseMessage"=>"Approved", "paymentType"=>"card"
}
```

### `.refund(flwRef)`

This is called to perform a `refund` of a preauth transaction.

#### Sample `refund` call:

```ruby
response = preauth.refund(response["flwRef"])
```

### `.void(flwRef)`

This is called to `void` a preauth transaction.

#### Sample `void` call:

```ruby
response = preauth.void(response["flwRef"])
```

### `.verify_preauth(txRef)`

The verify_preauth method can be called after capture is successfully completed by passing the `txRef` from the `charge` or `capture` response as its argument as shown below.

#### Sample `verify_preauth` call:

```ruby
response = preauth.verify_preauth(response["txRef"])
```

#### which returns:

It returns this response in Ruby hash. A sample response:

## `UgandaMobileMoney.new(rave)`

To perform uganda mobile money transactions, instantiate the uganda mobile money object and pass rave object as its argument.

Its functions includes:

- `.initiate_charge`
- `.verify_charge`

### `.initiate_charge(payload)`

This function is called to initiate uganda mobile money transaction. The payload should be a Ruby hash with uganda mobile money details. Its parameters should include the following:

- `amount`,

- `email`,

- `phonenumber`,

- `network`,

You can also add your custom transaction reference `(txRef)`, if not, one would be automatically generated for you in which we used the ruby `securerandom` module for generating this in the `Util` module.

#### Sample `initiate_charge` call:

```ruby
response = charge_uganda_mobile_money.initiate_charge(payload)
```

#### which returns:

It returns this response in Ruby hash. A sample response:

```ruby
{
    "error"=>false, "status"=>"success-pending-validation", "validation_required"=>true, "txRef"=>"MC-c716f37ff7c0f719c5976aaf239e11e1", "flwRef"=>"flwm3s4m0c1546503628014", "amount"=>30, "currency"=>"UGX", "validateInstruction"=>nil, "authModelUsed"=>"MOBILEMONEY", "paymentType"=>"mobilemoneygh"
}
```

### `.verify_charge(txRef)`

You can call the `verify_charge` function to check if your transaction was completed successfully. To do this, you have to pass the transaction reference generated at the point of making your charge call. This is the txRef in the response parameter returned in any of the `initiate_charge` call.

#### Sample `verify_charge` call:

```ruby
response = charge_uganda_mobile_money.verify_charge(response["txRef"])
```

#### which returns:

It returns this response in Ruby hash with the `txRef`, `flwRef` and `transaction_complete` which indicates the transaction is successfully completed.

Full sample response returned if a transaction is successfully verified:

```ruby
{
    "error"=>false, "transaction_complete"=>false, "data"=>{"txid"=>378423, "txref"=>"MC-c716f37ff7c0f719c5976aaf239e11e1", "flwref"=>"flwm3s4m0c1546503628014", "devicefingerprint"=>"N/A", "cycle"=>"one-time", "amount"=>30, "currency"=>"UGX", "chargedamount"=>30, "appfee"=>0.8, "merchantfee"=>0, "merchantbearsfee"=>1, "chargecode"=>"02", "chargemessage"=>"Pending Payment Validation", "authmodel"=>"MOBILEMONEY", "ip"=>"::ffff:10.65.63.158", "narration"=>"Simply Recharge", "status"=>"success-pending-validation", "vbvcode"=>"N/A", "vbvmessage"=>"N/A", "authurl"=>"NO-URL", "acctcode"=>nil, "acctmessage"=>nil, "paymenttype"=>"mobilemoneygh", "paymentid"=>"N/A", "fraudstatus"=>"ok", "chargetype"=>"normal", "createdday"=>4, "createddayname"=>"THURSDAY", "createdweek"=>1, "createdmonth"=>0, "createdmonthname"=>"JANUARY",
"createdquarter"=>1, "createdyear"=>2019, "createdyearisleap"=>false, "createddayispublicholiday"=>0, "createdhour"=>8, "createdminute"=>20, "createdpmam"=>"am", "created"=>"2019-01-03T08:20:27.000Z", "customerid"=>66732, "custphone"=>"054709929300", "custnetworkprovider"=>"UNKNOWN PROVIDER", "custname"=>"Edward Kisane", "custemail"=>"tester@flutter.co", "custemailprovider"=>"COMPANY EMAIL", "custcreated"=>"2018-12-03T11:33:23.000Z", "accountid"=>6076, "acctbusinessname"=>"Simply Recharge", "acctcontactperson"=>"Jolaoso Yusuf", "acctcountry"=>"NG", "acctbearsfeeattransactiontime"=>1, "acctparent"=>1, "acctvpcmerchant"=>"N/A", "acctalias"=>nil, "acctisliveapproved"=>0, "orderref"=>"URF_MMGH_1546503627253_1491735", "paymentplan"=>nil, "paymentpage"=>nil, "raveref"=>nil, "meta"=>[]}
}
```

If the `chargecode` returned is `02`, it means the transaction is still pending validation else if it returns `00`, it means the transaction is successfully completed.
